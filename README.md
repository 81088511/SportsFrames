## SportsFrames

SportFrames is a fully functional iOS sample app created to demonstrate the use of [LaneKit](https://github.com/larryaasen/LaneKit), a tool that provides Objective-C models for integration with [RestKit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit). This app displays a nice list of current sports related images. Tapping on a image plays the corresponding video. There are two models in this app that were both created by LaneKit version 0.1.6.
